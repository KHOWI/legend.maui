This is a text based game, meaning that the game is operated entirely through text.

Tutorial: It's pretty self-explanatory, get to the star of Tangaroa while making sure that you don't starve.

To eat, enter Eat or E in a single sentence without the prescence of the word Fish.
To fish, enter the word fish or fishing.
To move, simply enter the direction that you want to head in.

Freeplay: You want to start off by moving towards the C tile, the cave entrance. Beware that the cave has dirt tiles and you can't fish!
Afterwards, head towards the I square where you'll receive the fishing rod of legends.
Exit the cave through the C on the top right.
Then, make your way to the '*', where you'll beat the game. Here, all you have to do is fish.
Congrats!
